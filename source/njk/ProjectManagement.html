    <button class= "section">What is a project?</button>
    <div class= "panel">A project is infinite with a defined start and finish, it has specific objectives and are made up of multiple different processes that are used to achieve. There are always people involved, who will benefit from the projects outcome.</div>
    <button class= "section">What is project management?</button>
    <div class="panel"><p>It is the processes involved in formally defining the language, methods and resources that will be used in completing your project, in a way that ensures there can be no confusion as to what needs to be done and how at any point in the lifetime of the project.</p>
    <p>Project can fail which can be if it went over the time limit, over budget or has not been completed. These can occur if the project has not been managed or lots of unexpected factors have effected it. </p></div>
		<button class="section">Common Principles</button>
		<div class= "panel">
			<p>There are some common principles that have to be looked into when thinking about a project. They are:</p>
	    <ul class="b">
	      <li><b>Work Division:</b> Thinking about all the deliveries that need to be completed along with the final product, this can be for the client or the company you are working for, like quality documentations, or testing documentations.</li>
	      <br><li><b>Communication Management:</b> Before starting a project always mention how you are going to communicate with each other, especially if it is a newly formed team. It is always advised to have more than one form of communication, so that when the first form fails, you have a back-up. Also mention how often you want to meet-up to give an update. Simple things like acronyms and technical languages should be defined at the start, and throughout the project. </li>
	      <br><li><b>Time Management:</b> The duration of the individual task and the whole project has to be considered at the start of the project. This should include the plan, reviews and reflections. Gantt chart can be used to present the time line. </li>
	      <br><li><b>Risk Management: </b>All project would have risks, even if it has been planned well. If you plan the risk that can occur during the project, you can either avoid them or be prepared when the risk has occurred. These risks can be identified from previous projects that are similar to this project; or common risks that have a high change of occurring on every project. When identifying the risk, take a note of what the probability is of it occurring and what the impact of it would be.</li>
	     	<br><li><b>Change Management: </b> A plan is only created for guidance, a project will always need to adapt to the new changes. You will always have to consider how this change can affect timing of the project.</li>
	      <br><li><b>Organisation Management:</b>You will have to identify stakeholders (anyone who has an interest in the outcome of the project). The stakeholders can be divided into 3 sections: Business, Supplier and User.The project team, which includes everyone from IT to Business. Within the project team individual roles must be identify so that is it clear of what everyone is doing.</li>
	      <br><li><b>Project Environment:</b>It is what the conditions surround the project, which can be thought as 2 questions:
	      <ul>
	      <li>It is clear <b>what</b> the project is expected to deliver</li>
	      <li>Is it clear <b>how</b> the project will achieve delivery</li>
